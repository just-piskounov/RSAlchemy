## Introduction
This repo contains a simple construction for the RSA algorithm from scratch, i.e from the elementary arithmatic operations. However, this is not by any shape or form
a proper implementation of the RSA algorithm. It is for educational purposes, and it is very poorely optimized. The goal is to showoff the process of constructing a
cryptoscheme as the RSA in a readable code, which you will find.

## Features
Files are self explanatory, feel free to explore. We have also included the text manipulation utils. Nothing at all needs to be imported, aside from bitarray in order
to apply the seave algotihm. RSA with PKC1 is also included.
